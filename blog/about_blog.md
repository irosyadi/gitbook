This folder will contain my weekly notes for everything I found and thought. It will be messed notes since my approach is _just write_. So it is just like semi-_zettelkasten_. Sometimes I will write in English, in the other times it will in Indonesian.

The notes work as a starting point to more deep and through notes in another folder. The flow will be look like this: 1. Write everything in a single weekly document into [blog](about_blog.md) folder or into [bookmarks](bookmarks.md) note. 2. Expand some interesting snippets in a weekly document into a single page note in [note](../note/about_note.md) folder. 3. Expand the interesting [bookmarks](bookmarks.md) into respective list folder: 4. [app](../app/about_app.md) folder for applications or softwares. 5. [book](../book/about_book.md) folder for books or tutorials. 4. Expand interesting notes in the [note](../note/about_note.md) into a tutorial or a book in their respective project folder, for example: 5. [markdown](../markdown/about_markdown.md)for project book about markdwon 6. [pvsystem](../pvsystem/about_pvsystem.md) for project tutorial about PV System
