# Blog

![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/1658c62c-2200-4af1-acd1-a9067c365da1/deploy-status)

This folder contains my monthly notes for everything I found and thought. They will be messed notes since my approach is *just write*. So they are just like semi-*zettelkasten* or even just bookmark handlers. Sometimes I will write in English, in the other times it will in Indonesian.

The notes in the blog work as a starting point to more deep and through notes in another folder. The workflow will be looked like this:
1. Write everything captured to monthly blog file or to specific related file, if it is available.
2. Expand some interesting snippets in a monthly file or bookmarks into article in [note] or [artikel] folder.
3. The notes in [note] or [artikel] folder will be thinking notes, reflecting my thinking.
4. Move some interesting links or bookmarks in a monthly file in [blog] folder into respective category folders such as [app], [book], [course], [research] folder, etc.
5. The notes in category folders will link-heavy notes (list of links with little explanation).
6. Expand interesting articles in the [note] or [artikel] folder into a tutorial or a book in their respective project-style folders, for examples: [markdown], [pvsystems], etc.
7. The notes in project-style folders will content-heavy notes (descriptive notes supported with citations (links)).
