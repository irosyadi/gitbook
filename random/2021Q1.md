## Ensembling

- Ensembling is the use of several independently trained models to form an overall prediction. The basic idea of ensembling is that individual models have weaknesses in different areas, which are compensated by the combination with predictions of other independently trained models. Possible ensembling strategies are e.g. majority voting, the use of a weighted average based on classifier confidences, or simply using the arithmetic mean of several predictions of different models and model architectures

    - **One** of the measures that prevent counterfeitting of banknotes.
    - The currency-detection algorithms implemented by software packages (such as Adobe Photoshop and in Printer/Copier) are sophisticated and multi-level. Obfuscation of the Eurion, distortion, or even removal in some cases, still allows the package to detect that the image is that of currency. This implies other detection techniques are also employed
