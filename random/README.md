# Random Notes

This folder contains my random notes for everything I found and thought. They will be messed notes since my approach is *just write*. So they are just like semi-*zettelkasten* or even just bookmark handlers. Sometimes I will write in English, in the other times it will in Indonesian.

The notes in the blog work as a starting point to more deep and through notes in another folder. The workflow will be looked like this:

1. Write everything captured to monthly blog file or to specific related file, if it is available.
2. Category some interesting things into a respective topic.

{% include list.liquid all=true %}
